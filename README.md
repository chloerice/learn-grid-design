# Learn Grid Design
## An interactive guide to building responsive grid systems from scratch.
---

I think it's important to understand what underlies the front end style libraries we all use daily. Bootstrap's grid system is a godsend, but I'm on a mission to be able to build any layout a designer throws at me from scratch.

After having completed other grid system learning games for flexbox, like [Flexbox Froggy](https://github.com/thomaspark/flexboxfroggy/) and [Tower Defense](https://github.com/channingallen/tower-defense), I'd learned the syntax but lacked the big picture context for where the properties fit into the box model in order to build a grid system from scratch.

My goal with Learn Grid Design is for you to come away with a full understanding of the CSS3 properties to use for building any grid system responsively without needing to rely on a framework. You won't just be learning syntax. You'll build systems from the ground up. You'll learn when and why to use flexbox vs grid. You'll be able to code 'in the dark' and save time avoiding a long, drawn out trial and error process because you'll understand how flex and grid properties rely on each other and on box model properties to render and flow as you expect them to.
